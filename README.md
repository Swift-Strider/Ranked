# Who is this for

This is for the server admin who doesn't want to search around for all of the different permission that exist or don't want to guess what permissions their giving away.

Use /rank, and the plugin will guide you through the rest.

**Planned Features**
- Ranks may inherit from multiple parent ranks.
- Ranks can be given with an expiration time or date.
- The plugin is clear about the Ranks and their permissions.
- Command syntax errors will open a form, so you don't retype your command!
- Automatically add ranks to new playersðŸ˜Ž, or give ranks to players with a certain join date.
- Specially crafted formsðŸ“‹, so you don't have to bother learning commands!
